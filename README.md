## Sharing

This application consists of Projects that belong to Users.

After completing the exercises, Users should be able to share their Projects with other Users.
Users should be able to follow other users as well.

## Exercise 1 - Model testing

### Project Sharing

Add a method to Project class called share_with, with the following signature.

```
project.share_with(users)
```

Add the following methods for users to have access to shared projects.

```
user.projects
user.shared_projects
user.visible_projects (user.projects + user.shared_projects)
```

Implement model tests to ensure all these new methods work as expected.


### User Following

Add a method to User called follow, with the following signature:

```
user.follow(other_user)
```

Add the following methods to user as well:

```
user.followers (returns the users that are following user)

user.following (returns the users that user is following)
```

Implement model tests to ensure these follow methods are working.


## Exercise 2 - Controller test
Implement a share action in the projects controller. For simplicity, add the form in the show view of projects.
This form will have a popup menu showing the other users, so that user can pick one to share project with and click submit (share).

## Exercise 3 - Feature test
Implement a feature test that:

* logs in user (user1)
* visit the project show view
* select a user (user2) to share the project with, from the popup menu you implemented in the controller test
* click submit to share the project with that user
* log out user1
* log in as user2
* visit the projects index page
* test that user2 can view the project just shared in the user2 project listing view (you will need to modify the index action to include all visible projects for user2)

## Testing Gems
This application uses Fabrication for fabricators, rspec for testing. For the integration test, you can optionally
use cucumber instead of rspec features.

## Front End
Run the rake db:seed to seed the database with users and projects.
Users are user_1@sharing.com, password: "password" for all of them.
Users go from user_1 to user_10.

### Ruby, Rails
This application is using Ruby 2.1.1 and Rails 4.1.1.

### To get started
```
$ bundle
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rspec
```
